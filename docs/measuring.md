Measure Documentation Quality
=============================

This page is about getting feedback from documentation users and controlling documentation quality quantitatively.

Building documentation is hard and you won't get it right first time round.
Therefore, you need to iterate. And that means that you need to get feedback
from your readers. So include analytics in your team!

1. Use quick embedded questions like "how useful was this site?" to get
   feedback.

2. TODO other ways to get feedback?
