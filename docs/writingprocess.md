Writing process
===============

This page is about process of creating documentation, from the view of a
writer.

Understand your readers
-----------------------

Ask yourself the following questions:

* Who is your audience?

    - Is it a single developer or a huge company?

* What does the reader already know? What kind of reader's knowledge can you
  assume?

    - Does the reader know the basic concepts from your project? I.e., if
      you're documenting MVC web framework, can you assume that your reader
      knows what is a model, view and controller?

    - Does the reader know the language your project is written in? What is
      their level?

* What is the goal of your reader?

    - Does they have some problem that he needs to solve?
    - Does they want to have the overview of your project or of some part of
      it?

Choose a template
-------------------

See [Templates](templates.md) for more info.

Write docs
----------

A common problem is to write too long sentences. Long sentences are bad because:

- They are hard to understand.
- Every piece of doc will be translated by google translator, which cannot
  handle complicated structures.

Solutions:

- Make cats arrive when you're writing.
- Write via dictation. We have "eye" and "ear" brains; when you listen to, you
  can't remember too much information (as opposed to when you can see the
  text). Ear brain can remember 3 out of 5 bullet points.

Use typewriter instead of computer -- you must not make mistakes.

What to do next?
----------------

The next thing to do after writing is editing your documentation. See "For Editors" section.
