Writing process
===============

PROPOSAL replace subsections with a list of steps:

1. asking questions before writing docs
2. choosing a template
3. writing docs
4. editing
5. testing docs on users
6. measuring documentation quality
7. iterating
8. maintenance?

questions you should answer before writing
------------------------------------------

- pick an audience and write only for it -- what is the audience's
  knowledge and what are their goals? 
- create personas of your users -- think what will users think about
  your doc? i.e. user = single developer, user = huge company and so on    

other advices which involves only the writer
--------------------------------------------

- make cats arrive when you're writing (short sentences)
- use typewriter instead of computer to write an outline

other advices
-------------

- write bad first drafts as motivation to expert writers
- draw documentation fast and deliver early 
- get someone to test your documentation; don't allow them to use any
  other resource; if they have to use Google, it's a bug in documentation
- give documention first (no implementation nor tests) and ask users
  what they would do next?


The next thing to do after writing is editing your documentation. See "For Editors" section.
