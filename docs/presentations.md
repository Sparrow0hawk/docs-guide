Presentations
=============

This is not about presentations for meetings. This is about presentation at i.e. conferences.

- do not share presentation slides, ask the audience to make their own
- slides without presenter are useless
- documentation (self guided, read) is different from presentation (presenter
  guided, heard)
- good presentation slides are bad documentation
- Q&A at the beginning?
