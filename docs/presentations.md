Presentations
=============

This page is about making presentation at i.e. conferences. This is not about
presentations for meetings.

1. Slides without presenter are useless. Therefore, do not share presentation
   slides, ask the audience to make their own notes.

2. Presentation is not a form of documentation. Presentation is presenter
   guided and heard while documentation is self guided and read. In other
   words, **good presentation slides are bad documentation** and vice versa.

3. Start presentation with Questions & Answers.
