Notes
=====

My private notes to keep track what is bad about this Guide.

The goal is to dump all knowledge from [Write the Docs
conferences](http://conf.writethedocs.org/).

Where we have duplication?
--------------------------

- Platform & Tools/Measuring Documentation Quality:
    + use embedded questions like "how useful was this site?"

- Meeting notes/Process
    + ask yourself the question who is the audience? 

- Meeting notes/Language
    + define, who, what, and when?
