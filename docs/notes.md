Notes
=====

My private notes.

The audience is:

- People who have some specific problem and are looking for solution. For
  example, a writer may write too long sentences. Solution: make cats arrive when writing. Or write via dictation.

- People who are looking for some standard of process of creating
  documentation. For these people, we should provide a checklist for each role.

The goal is to dump all knowledge from [Write the Docs
conferences](http://conf.writethedocs.org/).
