Notes
=====

My private notes to keep track what is bad about this Guide.

Ideas
-----

* start each topic with three most important advices

Where we have duplication?
--------------------------

- Culture/Process

- Language/Process:
  + write via dictation to break long sentences; we have "eye" and "ear"
    brains; when you listen to, you can't remember too much information (as
    opposed to when you can see the text)

- Technologies/Measuring Documentation Quality:
  + use embedded questions like "how useful was this site?"

- Meeting notes/Process
  + ask yourself the question who is the audience? 

- Meeting notes/Language
  + define, who, what, and when?
