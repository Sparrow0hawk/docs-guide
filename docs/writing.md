Writing Documentation
=====================

A common problem is to write too long sentences. Long sentences are bad because:

- They are hard to understand.
- Every piece of doc will be translated by google translator, which cannot
  handle complicated structures.

Solutions:

- Make cats arrive when you're writing.
- Write via dictation. We have "eye" and "ear" brains; when you listen to, you
  can't remember too much information (as opposed to when you can see the
  text). Ear brain can remember 3 out of 5 bullet points.

Use typewriter instead of computer -- you must not make mistakes.

What to do next?

The next thing to do after writing is editing your documentation. See "For Editors" section.
