Understand Reader
=================

This page is about the first step for writer, that is asking themself some questions.

Ask yourself the following questions:

* Who is your audience?

    - Is it a single developer or a huge company?

* What does the reader already know? What kind of reader's knowledge can you
  assume?

    - Does the reader know the basic concepts from your project? I.e., if
      you're documenting MVC web framework, can you assume that your reader
      knows what is a model, view and controller?

    - Does the reader know the language your project is written in? What is
      their level?

* What is the goal of your reader?

    - Does they have some problem that he needs to solve?
    - Does they want to have the overview of your project or of some part of
      it?

What to do next?

Now, you should choose a template (see [Templates](templates.md)) and then, start [Writing Documentation](writing.md).
