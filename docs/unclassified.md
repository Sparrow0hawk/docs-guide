Observations
------------

- introducing code base to a new employee takes time and costs
- documentation is not the same as communication
- it's important to have right links in search engines

other practical advices
-----------------------

- small companies make better documentation

- use lists instead of paragraphs
- use hashtags
- use "verbosity" option in documentation so the reader can choose the level of
  details described
- fix product failures instead of documenting around them
- mistakeproofing.com
