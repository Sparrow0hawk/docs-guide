Everything That Does Not Fit Anything
=====================================

TODO: Classify it!

Observations
------------

- introducing code base to a new employee takes time and costs
- [dist] code says what and how, docs tells why
- information is no longer a value; filtering information and giving us
  the right information and teaching us is now a value
- internet is many-to-many communication 
- lack of documentation is marketing problem
- people care more about documentation if they are accountable for it
  personally (bugs in documentation)
- documentation is not the same as communication
- documentation -- tactical thinking
- it's important to have right links in search engines
- docs were written for users who already signed up, now it needs to be
  marketed to potential users too; docs is marketing; it's like shop window
- people can get to your docs through different paths because web is
  just pages with hyperlinks
- documentation must be easily searchable (cannot lack an index)

what docs should be about?
--------------------------

- the docs should say what is the good default (i.e. what encryption
  should I use?)
- describe common use cases
- assume that user doesn't know what he doesn't know; don't provide
  defaults, provide recommendations;
- compare bad/good; too less/enough/too much; before/after;
  good/better/best;
- explain "why?" (the reason for some decisions).

other practical advices
-----------------------

- use Empathy when writing API reference

    * Emphaty - ability to mutually experience the thoughts, emotions, and
      direct experience of others
    * Sympathy - feeling of care or concern for the state of another
    * use your own API
    * use other APIs and their docs
    * know your readers -- survey them
    * sample code and writing instructions are most important for reference
      users
    * tell true stories ==> give use cases
    * provide friendly UI
        + single page docs & click insanity
        + better typography
    * reference completeness is not enough
    * give most attention to your API's most common endpoints and methods;
      provide order for them
    * document edge cases!
    * provide meaningful error messages and HTTP response codes
    * role examples: [twillo](twilio.com)
    * provide "debugging errors" section

- don't follow big companies, follow the small ones
- small companies make better documentation

- use lists instead of paragraphs
- use hashtags
- use "verbosity" option in documentation so the reader can choose the level of
  details described
- fix product failures instead of documenting around them
- mistakeproofing.com

- in Wordpress they have a roadmap for documentation
