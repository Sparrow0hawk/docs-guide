Everything That Does Not Fit Anything
=====================================

TODO: Classify it!

Observations
------------

- lack of documentation is social problem, not technical 
- there are "design patterns" in documentation:
  - tell a story -- follow a linear timeline -- walkthrough
  - paint a picture -- describe everything on the screen -- introduce a
    feature or tool
  - reference -- introduce one at a time and describe
  - theme + situations -- idea and use cases -- Introduction to a concept
  - drill down -- general to specific
  - level up -- start simple (information hiding) and reveal it as you go
    along -- Getting Started
- wrong doc is better than no doc because others will quickly correct
  it
- introducing code base to a new employee takes time and costs
- others people are confused too, don't be ashame of that
- [dist] code says what and how, docs tells why
- information is no longer a value; filtering information and giving us
  the right information and teaching us is now a value
- man documentation is bad because it's a reference, not a tutorial
- internet is many-to-many communication 
- [dist] documentation (self guided, read) is different from presentation
  (presenter guided, heard)
- good presentation slides are bad documentation
- lack of documentation is marketing problem
- new users find different bugs than people who know the project
- beginners are great at writing templates
- experts are usually too busy
- people care more about documentation if they are accountable for it
  personally (bugs in documentation)
- translation costs are huge (0.25$ / word)
- documentation is not the same as communication
- documentation is a product
- documentation -- tactical thinking
- it's important to have right links in search engines
- small companies make better documentation
- the frustration is biggest at the beginning of using library
- doc written by developers, not special people
- docs were written for users who already signed up, now it needs to be
  marketed to potential users too; docs is marketing; it's like shop window
- people can get to your docs through different paths because web is
  just pages with hyperlinks
- every piece of doc will be translated (even by google translator)
- it's harder for smart people to follow "one topic per one sentence"
  rule

what docs should be about?
--------------------------

- the docs should say what is the good default (i.e. what encryption
  should I use?)
- describe common use cases
- assume that user doesn't know what he doesn't know; don't provide
  defaults, provide recommendations;
- compare bad/good; too less/enough/too much; before/after;
  good/better/best;

other practical advices
-----------------------

- make spec
- encourage user to point out in wiki what is missing 
- edit wiki every few days so it looks active
- write thanks to the volunteer writers publicly (i.e. on Twitter!)
- give people personal permission to edit wiki
- best editors are most afraid of screwing it up
- intentionally leave some typos or other easy edit tasks to encourage
  people to edit wiki
- write bad first drafts as motivation to expert writers
- encourage beginners to write docs
- ask people to write doc
- create lots of articles on wiki to attract users (they will twitt to
  these articles)
- show writers that people read their work; so users should ask writers
  for some missing info or support (less fun); or copyedit their stuff
  (proves somebody read it!)
- if you do not have any editors, ask OReilly for help and releasing
  your documentation as a book
- show, don't tell
- reduce friction especially at the beginning
- use quick form to get feedback
- think holistically about documentation      

problems
--------

- APIdocs
- language support
- not a wiki 
- feature requests -- long way (why not just edit wiki page?)
