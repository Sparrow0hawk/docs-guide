Everything That Does Not Fit Anything
=====================================

TODO: Classify it!

Observations
------------

- lack of documentation is social problem, not technical 
- introducing code base to a new employee takes time and costs
- [dist] code says what and how, docs tells why
- information is no longer a value; filtering information and giving us
  the right information and teaching us is now a value
- internet is many-to-many communication 
- lack of documentation is marketing problem
- people care more about documentation if they are accountable for it
  personally (bugs in documentation)
- documentation is not the same as communication
- documentation -- tactical thinking
- it's important to have right links in search engines
- docs were written for users who already signed up, now it needs to be
  marketed to potential users too; docs is marketing; it's like shop window
- people can get to your docs through different paths because web is
  just pages with hyperlinks
- documentation must be easily searchable (cannot lack an index)

what docs should be about?
--------------------------

- the docs should say what is the good default (i.e. what encryption
  should I use?)
- describe common use cases
- assume that user doesn't know what he doesn't know; don't provide
  defaults, provide recommendations;
- compare bad/good; too less/enough/too much; before/after;
  good/better/best;

other practical advices
-----------------------

- make spec
- if you do not have any editors, ask OReilly for help and releasing
  your documentation as a book
- show, don't tell
- think holistically about documentation
- "readme driven development" -- write readme before everything else
- use Empathy when writing API reference
  - Emphaty - ability to mutually experience the thoughts, emotions, and direct
    experience of others
  - Sympathy - feeling of care or concern for the state of another
  - use your own API
  - use other APIs and their docs
  - know your readers -- survey them
  - sample code and writing instructions are most important for reference users
  - tell true stories ==> give use cases
  - provide friendly UI
    - single page docs & click insanity
    - better typography
  - reference completeness is not enough
  - give most attention to your API's most common endpoints and methods;
    provide order for them
  - document edge cases!
  - provide meaningful error messages and HTTP response codes
  - role examples: [twillo](twilio.com)
  - provide "debugging errors" section
- how-tos

other (unclassified unclassified)
---------------------------------

- Minimum Viable Documentation ASAP; use template
- different types of documentation: tutorial vs guide vs reference
