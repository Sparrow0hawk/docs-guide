Process
=======

This page explains the process of creating documentation and different people
roles.

There are following steps of creating documentation (note that some of these can be executed simultaneously, that is asynchronously):

1. **An organizer**

    * provides [Platform & Tools](platform.md) to create documentation and
      overcome technical barriers,
    * provides [Templates](templates.md),
    * enforces initial [Documentation Structure](structure.md),
    * provides some roadmap for creating documentation (waterfall seem to work
      in documentation)(this approach is used in i.e. Wordpress),
    * promotes [Culture](culture.md) of creating documentation and
    * in the case of open source projects, takes care about entire
      [Community](community.md) and encourage it to contribute to your project.

2. **A manager**

    * splits work between people and takes care of [Managing
      People](managing.md),
    * at meetings creates [Meeting Notes](meetings.md).

3. **A writer**

    * [Understands Reader](understandreader.md) and asks who is their audience,
    * chooses appropriate [Documentation Type](doctypes.md) and a
      [Template](templates.md)
    * chooses a template,
    * [Writes Documentation](writing.md) or improves it and
    * writes [Tutorials](tutorials.md) or improves existing ones.

4. **An editor** edits the documentation [Style](style.md).

5. **A designer** takes care of layout, formatting, [UI](ui.md) and
   readability.

6. **An analytic** 

    * tests the documentation on readers and get feedback from them,
    * [Measures Documentation Quality](measuring.md) and makes conclusions.

7. The next iteration happens because building documentation is hard and you
   won't get it right first time round.

**A presenter** creates [Presentations](presentations.md), not documentation!

Note that one person can have many roles, i.e. a writer can be its own editor
(however it's not recommended).
