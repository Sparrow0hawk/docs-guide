This page is about how to organize creating documentation and split it between
people.

The most important observation is that novices are usually better at writing
and editing documentation as well as writing [templates](templates.md). There are some reasons for that:

1. They are beginners and, therefore, are in the same situation as reader. They
   don't have to imagine what questions may a reader have -- they just have
   such questions.

2. New developers find different bugs than people who know the project.

Therefore, you should pair writers with new developers. Documentation should be edited by only beginners. Templates also should be written by novices.

Smart people are not the best writers because it's hard for them to follow "one
topic per one sentence" rule since they are just... too smart.
