Process
=======

PROPOSAL replace subsections with a list of steps:

1. asking questions before writing docs
2. choosing a template
3. writing docs
4. editing
5. testing docs on users
6. measuring documentation quality
7. iterating
8. maintenance?

questions you should answer before writing
------------------------------------------

- pick an audience and write only for it -- what is the audience's
  knowledge and what are their goals? 
- create personas of your users -- think what will users think about
  your doc? i.e. user = single developer, user = huge company and so on    

other advices which involves only the writer
--------------------------------------------

- make cats arrive when you're writing (short sentences)
- use typewriter instead of computer to write an outline
- put topics on post-it stickers to organize them; size of post-it
  limits the amount of words

other advices
-------------

- get someone to test your documentation; don't allow them to use any
  other resource; if they have to use Google, it's a bug in documentation
- pair with new developers to make docs as they have questions    
- draw documentation fast and deliver early 
- give documention first (no implementation nor tests) and ask users
  what they would do next?
- editing is important, you need an editor http://jacobian.org/writing/editors/

observations
------------

- new users find different bugs than people who know the project
- beginners are great at writing templates
- experts are usually too busy
- doc written by developers, not special people (like editors)
- it's harder for smart people to follow "one topic per one sentence"
