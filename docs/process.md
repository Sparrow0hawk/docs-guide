Process
=======

- pair with new developers to make docs as they have questions    
- new users find different bugs than people who know the project
- beginners are great at writing templates
- experts are usually too busy
- doc written by developers, not special people (like editors)
- it's harder for smart people to follow "one topic per one sentence"
