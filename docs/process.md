Process
=======

This page explains the process of creating documentation.

There are following steps of creating documentation:

1. **An organizer**

    * provides platform and tools to create documentation,
    * provides [documentation templates](templates.md),
    * promotes culture of creating documentation,
    * overcome technical barriers,
    * enforces initial structure of documentation and
    * enforce some Best Practices to standardize docs.

2. **A writer**

    * understands their reader,
    * chooses a template and
    * writes/improves documentation.

3. **An editor** edits the documentation.

4. **A designer** takes care of layout, formatting, UI and readability.

5. **An analytic** 

    * tests the documentation on readers,
    * get feedback from them,
    * measures the documentation quality and
    * makes conclusions.

6. **A manager**

    * creates meeting notes and
    * disturbs other people.

7. The next iteration happens.

**A presenter** create presentations, not documentation!

Note that one person can have many roles, i.e. a writer can be its own editor
(however it's not recommended).
