Process
=======

questions you should answer before writing
------------------------------------------

- pick an audience and write only for it -- what is the audience's
  knowledge and what are their goals? 
- create personas of your users -- think what will users think about
  your doc? i.e. user = single developer, user = huge company and so on    

other advices which involves only the writer
--------------------------------------------

- make cats arrive when you're writing (short sentences)
- use typewriter instead of computer to write an outline
- put topics on post-it stickers to organize them; size of post-it
  limits the amount of words

other advices
-------------

- get someone to test your documentation; don't allow them to use any
  other resource; if they have to use Google, it's a bug in documentation
- pair with new developers to make docs as they have questions    
- draw documentation fast and deliver early 
- give documention first (no implementation nor tests) and ask users
  what they would do next?
