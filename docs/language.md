Language
========

Some language structures, tenses etc. makes docs unclear. This page is about
what kind of language to use.

General advices
---------------

- Avoid passive voice and clearly state who is the subject. It's also hard to
  translate passive voice to some languages.

- Use the noun (referent) instead of "it" when "it" is undefined or can be
  unclear.

- Use specific terms instead of vague and generic ones.

- Name your ideas.

- Be terse. Translation costs are huge (0.25$ / word / language)

- Make your sentences simple.

- Use simple words. You can prepare a list of common simple English words and
  configure your text editor to underline all words that are not in the list.

- Use [hemingwayapp.com](http://hemingwayapp.com).

- Follow [RFC language guide](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2119.html).

- Read good example: 

    + Vintage cookbooks
    + Martha Stewart
    + Dorothy Parker

Simplified Technical English
----------------------------

Use [Simplified Technical English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Technical_English) which is a carefully limited and standardized subset of English to reduce ambiguity.

- Write shorter sentences.

- One topic per sentence (especially important for smart people because it's
  harder for smart people to follow this rule).

- Use valid nomenclature. No slang!

- There are four basic sentence structures:

    + Statement, description or explanation.
    + Step and action (procedures)
    
        > "put switch in out" => "move the switch to the off position"
        
    + Cause and effect (fault isolation)
    
        > "test the voltage after the circuit energizes" => "energize the
        > circuit , then make a test of the voltage"

    + Call-outs, tables and headlines (illustrations).

- Avoid gerunds (-ing).

- Avoid nouns as verbs (i.e. "test" => "make a test").

- Avoid conditional tenses.

- Use "can" to indicate a possibility.

- Avoid word clusters.
