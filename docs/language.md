Language
========

- unclear documentation
- don't use passive -- clearly state who is the subject
- undefined "it" -- use the noun (referent) instead of "it"
- vague, generic terms -- use
- unnamed idea -- name your ideas 
- be terse because translation costs are huge (0.25$ / word / language)
- every piece of doc will be translated (even by google translator) 
- make your documentation terser with hemingwayapp.com 
- use simplified English
- use active voice (it's hard to translate passive voice to some languages)
- write shorter sentences
- one topic per sentence
- it's harder for smart people to follow "one topic per one sentence"
  rule 
- use valid nomenclature
- there are four basic sentence structures
  - statement, description or explanation
  - step and action (procedures); "put switch in out" => "move the switch to
    the off position"
  - cause and effect (fault isolation); "test the voltage after the circuit
    energizes" => "energize the circuit , then make a test of the voltage"
  - call-outs, tables and headlines (illustrations) 
- do not use gerunds (-ing)
- do not use nouns as verbs
- avoid conditional tenses
- to indicate a possibility, use "can"
- avoid word clusters
- write via dictation to break long sentences; we have "eye" and "ear" brains;
  when you listen to, you can't remember too much information (as opposed to
  when you can see the text)
- ear brain can remember 3 out of 5 bullet points

"design patterns" in documentation
----------------------------------

- tell a story -- follow a linear timeline -- walkthrough
- paint a picture -- describe everything on the screen -- introduce a
  feature or tool
- reference -- introduce one at a time and describe
- theme + situations -- idea and use cases -- Introduction to a concept
- drill down -- general to specific
- level up -- start simple (information hiding) and reveal it as you go
  along -- Getting Started
