Meeting notes
=============

- ask yourself the question who is the audience?
- create a shared need
- avoid chronology
- for each section, include impact to team member, use red color 
- engage experts in writing the notes when you are not expert
- define, who, what, and when?
- use collaborative tools
- offer Easter Egg to combat tl;dr syndrome (i.e. chocolate for
  everybody who has read the note)
- at the meeting, spend first 10 minutes to read document, then
  discuss; no presentation
- presentation vs conversation
