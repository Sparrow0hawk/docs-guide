Templates
=========

This page is about using templates to i.e. standardize documentation.

One of the worst things in writing documentation is when you start with the blank page. You have no idea, what questions you should answer and how the page should be structured.

Using templates solves two problems. First, it's a tool to enforce
standardization, that is each page has the same structure. This lowers the time
of searching documentation. The second reason to use templates is to include
there question checklist to show writers what information they should include.
