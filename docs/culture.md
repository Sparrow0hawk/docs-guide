Culture
=======

This is page is about how to promote culture of creating documentation and
resist the temptation to avoid doing it.

Practical advices
-----------------

1. Promote "code -> test -> doc -> ship it". Friends don't allow other friends
   to push code without documentation in the same way they don't allow not to
   write tests. Documentation is also a product.

2. Make DocDays -- a "hackathon" when developers create some kind of
   documentation.

3. Use gamification.

4. Publicly ashame people that they don't create documentation.

5. Make a culture of reviewing documentation in the same way as you have code
   reviews. That way developers know their are not anonymous and finally their
   documentation will be seen by other developers.

6. Encourage developers to improve documentation. Advices on [Community
   page](community.md) may be useful.
