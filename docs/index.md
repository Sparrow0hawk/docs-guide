The Hitchhiker's Guide to Documentation!
========================================

Welcome to The Hitchhiker's Guide to Documentation.

This *opinionated* guide exists to provide developers advices and a
best-practice handbook to the documentation on a daily basis.

This Guide is under my active development. My goal is to dump all knowledge
from [Write the Docs conferences](http://conf.writethedocs.org/). 

**Feel free to give feedback, criticize or contribute! Don't afraid to mention
what is missing. Every comment is welcome!**

See this project on [github](TODO).
