The Hitchhiker's Guide to Documentation!
========================================

This Guide exists to provide developers advices and a best-practice handbook to
the documentation on a daily basis.

This Guide is under my active development. My goal is to dump all knowledge
from [Write the Docs conferences](http://conf.writethedocs.org/). 

**Feel free to [give feedback, criticize or
contribute!](https://github.com/chrismedrela/docs-guide/issues/new) Don't
afraid to mention what is missing. Every comment is welcome!** By the way, The
Guide Style Guide is this Guide.

See this project on [github](https://github.com/chrismedrela/docs-guide) or
[readthedocs.org](http://docs-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

How to read this Guide?
-----------------------

If you are not included in the following list, please [tell us
that](https://github.com/chrismedrela/docs-guide/issues/new)!

* Most developers are documentation **writers**.
* Once you finished writing documentation, you should find an **editor** or you
  should edit yourself your draft.
* **Organizers** promote culture of writing documentation, split work between
  people, overcome technical barriers, create some initial structure for
  documentation, standarize documentation etc.
* **Designers** take care of documentation UI, readability and also marketing
  side.
* **Analytics** get feedback from readers, analyze it and make conclusions to
  make the next iteration better.
* **Managers** can make their meeting notes better.
* **Presenters** create presentations, not documentation!
