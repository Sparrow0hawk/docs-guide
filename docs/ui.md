Formatting
==========

1. Use "pocos" -- huge text put on the margin for readers who only glance at
   the text.

2. Use colors.

3. Use icons. You can find free icons on the net.

4. Step-by-step ("step one", "step two" sections in tutorials).

Use code snippets, diagrams, icons and so on helps to overcome the monotony of
text.
