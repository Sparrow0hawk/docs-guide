General Notes
=============

1. Bad documentation is usually social problem, not technical one.

2. Documentation is often read by managers who choose products. Writers often
   forget that they are writing not only for technical audience, but their
   documentation is also like a shop window. Now, documentation is read not
   only by readers who already signed in, but also by potential users. Lack of documentation is also marketing problem.
