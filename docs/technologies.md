Technologies
============

- doc checked in repo
- doc is plain text (Restructured Text at Twitter)
- every doc easily accessible -- there must be one page with links to
  all existing docs
- underline all nontrivial words which has no definition
- link to howtos from your marketing site and new user experience
- use quick embedded questions like "how useful was this site?" to get feedback
- what formats to use? markdown?
- good platform & technical solution
  + readthedocs
  + DocBird at Twitter
- make it responsive
- single page (avoid click insanity)
  + scrolling is natural
  + search is free in browsers
  + persistent navigation (no need to scroll to go to navigation)
  + dynamic orientation (navigation shows where you are)
  + downsides:
    * hard to link to
    * google will land you in wrong section 
  + do not mix guides with API reference
  + good for technical docs, bad from marketing point

problems
--------

- APIdocs
- language support
- not a wiki 
- feature requests -- long way (why not just edit wiki page?)
