=========

- encourage user to point out in wiki what is missing 
- edit wiki every few days so it looks active
- write thanks to the volunteer writers publicly (i.e. on Twitter!)
- give people personal permission to edit wiki
- best editors are most afraid of screwing it up
- intentionally leave some typos or other easy edit tasks to encourage
  people to edit wiki
- write bad first drafts as motivation to expert writers
- encourage beginners to write docs
- create lots of articles on wiki to attract users (they will twitt to
  these articles)
- show writers that people read their work; so users should ask writers
  for some missing info or support (less fun); or copyedit their stuff
  (proves somebody read it!)
